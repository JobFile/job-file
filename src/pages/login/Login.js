import { ErrorMessage, Formik, Form, Field } from 'formik';
import * as yup from 'yup';
/* Formik - helps you to write the three most annoying parts of building a form: Getting values in and out of form state. Validation and error messages. Handling form submission. Yup and Formik are both packages that can be installed into a React application. Formik is built specifically to work with React, but Yup can be used with any front-end framework.
Formik is a form-building library. It provides you with out-of-the-box React form elements that can be quickly added to your React app. It takes care of the boilerplate, and automates the repetitive tasks of form-building, like error handling, validation, and visited/required fields.

import axios from 'axios';
// axios - is an HTTP client library based on promises. It makes sending asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints easier and helps you perform CRUD operations. This REST endpoint/API could be an external API like the Google API, GitHub API, and so on â€“ or it could be your own backend Node. js server. Axios is more secure than fetch

import { history } from '../../history';
// history - lets you easily manage session history anywhere JavaScript runs. A history object abstracts away the differences in various environments and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, and persist state between sessions.
